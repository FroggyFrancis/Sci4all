    <p1>WELCOME TO BIOMECHANICS!</p1>
    <br>
    <p2>Biomechanics is the application of mechanical principles to living organisms, such as humans, animals, plants and the functional basic units of life, the cells. While this may sound headache-inducing to many, biomechanics is one of the oldest, most primary examples of human engineering. Aristotle, in his book “On the Movement of Animals” defined animals’ bodies as mechanical systems. This is a key to biomechanics as it is the study that views the body as a machine of action. In biomechanics, we study actions of the muscles and bones via physical, kinetic analysis. This enables us to replicate, find inspiration from, and get feedback from evolution, the longest engineering project ever existed.</p2>
