      <h1><b>SciForAll Introduction for New Members</b></h1>
      <h3><b>What is SciForAll?</b></h3>
      <h5>
        SciForAll is a student-led non-profit organization that aims to provide more opportunities for K-12 students to learn, investigate, and write about various different science fields. We also focus on creating easily accessible STEM resources for students in junior high and elementary school. We are looking forward to motivating future generations to be interested in science and join the exciting journey of new discoveries.
      </h5>
      <br>
      <h3><b>How does our schedule work?</b></h3>
      <h5>
        SciForAll has various projects for each ‘chapter’ of the year. Each chapter lasts approximately for a school semester. During each chapter, we focus on a couple specific projects, and we switch our projects at each chapter. 
        <br>Currently, SciForAll is in chapter 1, which lasts for the entire Spring semester of 2024 school year. Therefore, chapter 2 will begin in the Fall semester of 2025 school year.
        <br>Additionally, we have chapter projects and constant projects. chapter projects are the projects that will last for a chapter. On the other hand, constant projects are open throughout the entire chapter.
