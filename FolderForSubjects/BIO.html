    <p1>WELCOME TO BIOLOGY!</p1>
    <br>
    <p2>To study biology means to understand the complex interactions between the internal processes and environmental factors that influence organisms. The basis of all of the complicated functions of life developed from simple, seemingly minuscule atoms and molecules. We must try to understand the importance of these basic molecules in shaping the expression of traits, and how these natural processes can be affected by environmental pressures in our surroundings. Additionally, biology is greatly involved in analyzing the impact of diseases on living populations, both animal and human. The essence of biology can be found in everything around us, and we must strive to recognize how our biological functions, genetic expression, and environmental responses continue to impact our daily lives.</p2>
