# This is an example of what your article should look like!

## Introduction

This is written in a language called [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). It's a way to write articles with things like headers, links, images, and quotes. It is like writing HTML, but much simpler.

## To write Markdown

1. You can learn how to write markdown [here](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/index.html), and use a text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and just start writing a file ending in .md
2. You can use an online editor, here are list of some:
    - [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/app)
    - [Mark](https://mark.barelyhuman.dev/)
    - [Holocron](https://holocron.so/markdown-editor)

## Conclusion

Please send your articles to us, in markdown format, or let us know if there is anything we can do to help. Thanks! :D
