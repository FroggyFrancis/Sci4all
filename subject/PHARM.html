            <br>
            <p2>Medicine has many many fields that cover overall health sciences. Mostly concerned with diagnosis, prognosis (expected development of diagnosis), prevention, treatment, etc. The medicine fields include internal medicine, pharmacy, anesthesiology, surgery, pediatrics, and so many more that go specifically into one aspect of health. Because this is such a broad subject, we will focus mostly on how to diagnose and treat injuries or diseases, while the other fields will explain what happens in specific areas during the time of the illness.
