# Welcome to Biology!

We break down the word “biology” into “bio-” and “-logy,” so you might say, “biology is the study of life.”

But it’s more than that, isn’t it?

To study biology means to understand how both internal processes and environmental factors influence organisms. It’s about the role of basic molecules in shaping the expression of traits, and how these natural processes can be affected by external pressures in our surroundings. Biology is also greatly involved in analyzing diseases that impact living populations, both animal and human. The essence of biology can be found in everything around us, and we must strive to understand how our biological functions, genetic expression, and environmental responses continue to impact our daily lives.
